# Rock_Paper_Scissors-Game

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors Game, a classic hand game implemented in Python. 
In this game, two players simultaneously choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. 
The winner is determined by the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
